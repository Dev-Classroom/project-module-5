## Project Brief

In this module, you learned how JavaScript powers dynamic content on the web. For this project, you're gonig to design a landing page catered to a user's preferences. Using APIs, you'll dynamically pull in content from remote resources on the web and provide a user with an easy-to-use landing page to power their morning. Each of these landing pages *should* be different as you and your classmates design and develop them, but there are a few guidelines below.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] Design System from Figma <br />
 - [ ] Prototype from Figma <br /> 
 - [ ] At least three outside APIs integrated within the landing page <br />
 - [ ] The ability for a user to enter their name and the page to 'know' who they are <br />
 - [ ] Fully functioning site, meeting requirements from brief, deployed to Github Pages <br />
